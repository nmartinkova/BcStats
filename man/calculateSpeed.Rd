\title{Estimate running speed from Arduino Lizards logs}
\usage{
calculateSpeed(inputFolder = NULL, outputFile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputFolder}{Path to the folder containing corrected log files. If not
provided, an interactive dialog opens.}

\item{outputFile}{Name of the file where calculated speeds will be saved. If
not provided, a filename is created from the folder name and the current date.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data.frame with the calculated values, while also
saving the results to \code{outputFile}.
}
\description{
Reads running logs produced by Tomas Fryza’s Arduino Lizards software for the
sand lizard racetrack and calculates maximum speed between consecutive sensors.
}
\details{
The function extracts the measurement date from each log file, reads
sensor timestamps, and converts the shortest time difference between two
neighbouring sensors into speed (meters per second). Negative or zero speeds
indicate a failed run and are separated into a file named
\emph{neuspesneExperimenty.txt}.

The output file contains, for each valid experiment, the animal ID,
temperature of the animal during the measurement, maximum speed, measurement
date, humidity, air temperature, and experiment ID.
}
\note{
Students should always check the saved output file rather than rely only
on the returned data frame. Confirm that the number of experiments matches
expectations and that failed runs are handled correctly.

# To run the function in an interactive mode, open the R console and type
calculateSpeed()
# Hit Enter and select a folder with running logs in the dialog box
